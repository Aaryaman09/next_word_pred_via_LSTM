# next_word_pred_via_LSTM
This project implements a next-word prediction model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) networks. The model is trained on a text corpus and deployed as a web application using Streamlit. Users can input a sequence of words, and the app predicts the most probable next word based on the trained deep learning models.
